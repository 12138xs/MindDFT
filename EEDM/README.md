# EEDM Model

## Introduction
The EEDM (Electron Density Model) aims to predict accurate ab initio DNA electron densities using equivariant neural networks. This model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to effectively capture the electronic characteristics of DNA structures.

## Run Command
To run the model, use the following command:
```bash
./runner.sh
```
